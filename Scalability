Introduction
This section outlines the approach for handling larger datasets efficiently in the OCR system. As the dataset size increases, challenges such as processing time, memory consumption, and I/O operations must be addressed. Below, we discuss strategies for optimizing scalability through flow design, parallel processing, and efficient data handling.

Flow Design
To ensure a streamlined workflow when handling large datasets, the following design principles are implemented:

Batch Processing: Instead of processing images one by one, the system processes batches of images to improve efficiency.
Pipeline Execution: The OCR workflow is divided into stages (Preprocessing → Region Detection → OCR Extraction → Data Storage) to allow parallel execution.

Asynchronous Processing: Tasks such as image reading and writing are handled asynchronously to minimize blocking operations.
Parallel Processing & Distributed Computing
Handling large datasets requires leveraging multiple CPU/GPU cores and distributed computing frameworks. The following approaches are used:

Multi-threading & Multi-processing
Multi-threading: Used for I/O-bound tasks such as reading images and saving CSV files.
Multi-processing: Image preprocessing and OCR processing are CPU-intensive, so the system utilizes Python’s multiprocessing module to distribute tasks across multiple cores.

GPU Acceleration
If deep learning-based OCR models are incorporated, GPU acceleration using CUDA or TensorFlow can significantly reduce processing time.
OpenCV and EasyOCR provide GPU support to accelerate image transformations and text detection.

Distributed Computing
For handling extremely large datasets across multiple machines:
Apache Spark or Dask: Used for distributed data processing when dealing with millions of images.
Cloud-based solutions: Integrating with AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions for serverless execution.
Efficient Data Handling Techniques
To optimize data loading, processing, and storage, the following techniques are employed:
Optimized Image Loading
Lazy Loading: Load images only when required instead of keeping them in memory.
Compression Techniques: Use WebP or JPEG2000 formats to reduce storage size while maintaining quality.
Memory Optimization
Avoiding Redundant Copies: Use in-place operations whenever possible.
Data Streaming: Read and process images in a stream instead of loading all at once.
Optimized Storage & Output Handling
CSV Compression: Store extracted data in compressed formats like Parquet or SQLite to optimize storage.

Database Integration: Instead of storing results in CSV files, integrate with a database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB for better scalability and retrieval.
